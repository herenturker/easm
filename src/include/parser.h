/**
 * @brief Processes a single tokenized line passed from the lexer.
 * 
 * This function takes a formatted token string (e.g., 
 * "Token: INSTR_MOV Lexeme: MOV") generated by the lexer, 
 * parses its content, and performs syntax analysis or other
 * processing depending on the token types and lexemes.
 * 
 * It is designed to be called after each line is processed by
 * the lexer and converted into a formatted string.
 * 
 * @param token_line A string containing the formatted token information 
 *                   from the lexer. Each call represents one token line.
