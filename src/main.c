 * @brief Entry point of the assembler program.
 *
 * This function reads an input file line-by-line, formats each line,
 * and passes it to the lexer for tokenization.
 *
 * @param argc Argument count.
 * @param argv Argument vector. The second argument (argv[1]) should be the input file name.
 * @return int Returns 0 on success, non-zero on error.
